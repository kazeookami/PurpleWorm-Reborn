# Purpleworm-Reborn

The website here is bundled with personal use on your own PC in mind.
The following instructions assume you are on a reasonably up to date windows PC with Python 3 installed.


1. Extract the contents of DataContent.zip into the base folder.
2. Open Command Prompt (Win+R → cmd → Enter).
3. Navigate to your website folder by typing cd C:\worm
4. python -m http.server 8000
5. Open your browser of choice and enter http://localhost:8000


Now that the direct important stuff is out of the way, I want to say I am not an AD&D 2e player. This was recovered and rebuilt as a favor to a friend, because I don't believe in valuable tools being lost to a massive community because one guy has a bad week. So, here it does. It's here for everyone. Let 90s gaming continue to live on.
